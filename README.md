# responsive_layout

The final challenge of my "21-day-conquering responsive layout challenges" from Kevin Powell, which was part of my learning CSS joruney.

Technologies used: html, CSS.

I learned how to make a website responsive, so that it looks good on mobile devices, as well as on big screens.

I learned a lot about global CSS settings, margins, paddings, widths, heights, CSS units, and where to use which, handling images, flexbox, grid, and media queries.

Most importantly, overall best practices for making responsive design.
