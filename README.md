The final challenge of my 21-day conquering responisve layouts from Kevin Powell which is part of my learning css joruney.

Technologies used: html, css.

I learned how to make a website responsive, so that it looks good on mobile devices, as well as on big screens.

I learned a lot about global css settings, margins, paddings, widths, heights, css units and where to use which, handling images, flexbox, grid and media queries.

Most importantely, overall best practices for making responsive design.
